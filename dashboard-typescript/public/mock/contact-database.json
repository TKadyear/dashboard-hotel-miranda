They are so personable, attentive helpful and caring of their guests. Also super funny and entertaining. We ran into maintenance taking care of trash while waiting for the elevator and these two men were so kind and such happy beings. The hotel itself is beautiful, extremely well-kept, and quiet. I slept so well throughout my entire stay-- the beds are super comfortable. The rooms are also very well designed. I highly recommend staying at this hotel and will definitely stay here again when I come back to NY! Thank you Motto staff for such excellent service :)",

Check in was easy and efficient. We found our room to be clean and comfortable- brand new! Quite beautiful. The view from our room as the sun was setting was spectacular! After an evening at the theatre ( highly recommend The Music Man!), the bar was open for a night cap. Breakfast was fresh and delicious served by more friendly staff. Our overall experience was exceptional! We’ll be back",
